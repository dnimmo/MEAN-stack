MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack exercise

Note, the exercise is based on Fantasy (American) Football. I don't know anything about NFL, but then I don't know anything about proper football either, so I figured it didn't really matter. 
For the record, I did consider making this a proper Fantasy (proper) Football thing, but as that would have meant learning about both football and fantasy football, I decided against it, so sue me.
